# RNN LSTM Time Series Prediction 

A Python project using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM layers to predict future values of a time series (stock prices, weather, etc.).

---

## Project Overview  
This project preprocesses time series data, builds an LSTM model, trains it, and visualizes predictions of the real dataset of Google stock prices (from Kaggle).

---

##  Features  
- Time series data preprocessing (normalization, windowing)  
- LSTM model implementation in TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Model training, evaluation, and saving  
- Prediction vs. True Value plots

---

##  Tech Stack  
- Python 3.10  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Installation & Usage
